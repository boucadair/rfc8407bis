This document defines the initial version of the IANA-maintained
"iana-foo" YANG module.  The most recent version of the YANG module
is available from the "YANG Parameters" registry
[IANA-YANG-PARAMETERS].

IANA is requested to add this note to the registry:

    New values must not be directly added to the "iana-foo" YANG
    module.  They must instead be added to the "foo" registry.

When a value is added to the "foo" registry, a new "enum" statement
must be added to the "iana-foo" YANG module.  The "enum" statement,
and sub-statements thereof, should be defined:

 "enum":        Replicates a name from the registry.

 "value":       Contains the decimal value of the IANA-assigned value.

 "status":      Is included only if a registration has been deprecated
                or obsoleted.  IANA "deprecated" maps to YANG status
                "deprecated", and IANA "obsolete" maps to YANG status
                "obsolete".

 "description":  Replicates the description from the registry.

 "reference":   Replicates the reference(s) from the registry with the
                title of the document(s) added.

Unassigned or reserved values are not present in the module.

When the "iana-foo" YANG module is updated, a new "revision"
statement with a unique revision date must be added in front of the
existing revision statements. The "revision" statement must have a
"reference" substatement that points specifically to the published
module (i.e., IANA_FOO_URL_With_REV).

IANA is requested to add this note to [reference-to-the-iana-foo-
registry]:

    When this registry is modified, the YANG module "iana-foo"
    [IANA_FOO_URL] must be updated as defined in RFC IIII.
