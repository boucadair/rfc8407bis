This document defines the initial version of the IANA-maintained
"iana-foo" YANG module.  The most recent version of the YANG module
is available from the "YANG Parameters" registry
[IANA-YANG-PARAMETERS].

IANA is requested to add this note to the registry:

   New values must not be directly added to the "iana-foo" YANG
   module.  They must instead be added to the "foo" registry.

When a value is added to the "foo" registry, a new "identity"
statement must be added to the "iana-foo" YANG module.  The name of
the "identity" MUST be the name as provided in the
registry.  The "identity" statement should have the following sub-
statements defined:

 "base":        Contains 'name-base-identity-defined-in-foo'.

 "status":      Include only if a registration has been deprecated or
                obsoleted.  IANA "deprecated" maps to YANG status
                "deprecated", and IANA "obsolete" maps to YANG status
                "obsolete".

 "description":  Replicates the description from the registry.

 "reference":   Replicates the reference(s) from the registry with
                the title of the document(s) added.

Unassigned or reserved values are not present in the module.

When the "iana-foo" YANG module is updated, a new "revision"
statement with a unique revision date must be added in front of the
existing revision statements. The "revision" statement must have a
"reference" substatement that points specifically to the published
module (i.e., IANA_FOO_URL_With_REV). If the updates are triggered
by an RFC, that RFC must also be included in the "reference" 
substatement. The "description" substatement should reflect what
changed in the revised version. Typically, the description text
enumerates the changes (e.g., list of the new registration entries). 

  --- If the changes are triggered by an RFC, insert this text:

 The "description" substatement should include this text:
 "Applied updates as specified by RFC XXXX.".

  --- If the changes are triggered following other IANA registration
  --- policy (Section 4 of [RFC8126]) but not all the values in the
  --- are not covered by the same policy, insert this text:

 The "description" substatement should include this text: 
 "Applied updated as specified by the registration policy 
  <Some_IANA_policy>".

IANA is requested to add this note to [reference-to-the-iana-foo-
registry]:

   When this registry is modified, the YANG module "iana-foo"
   [IANA_FOO_URL] must be updated as defined in RFC IIII.
